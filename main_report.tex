\section{Introduction}
When Donald Trump, the current president of the United States of America, was asked to explain calling women ''fat pigs'', ''dogs'', ''slobs'' and ''disgusting animals'' his reply was:
\textit{I’ve been challenged by so many people, I don’t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn’t have time either.'}
%https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/30/political-correctness-how-the-right-invented-phantom-enemy-donald-trump
In contrast to Mr Trump, the authors of the present paper had time. We provide a formal framework in order to analyze the pragmatic phenomenon of harmful use of language.

We are interested in explaining under which circumstances speakers will be disposed to alter their way of expressing themselves. Specifically, we will analyse the situation where a speaker is indifferent about various communicative options, while the audience dislikes some of the alternatives. Although the wording of a message might not affect the transfer of information, it can have an impact on the listener. Obvious cases in point are racial slurs and so-called ''trigger words'' which cause listeners suffering from postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to re-live past trauma. \cite{fagan2004confronting, yehuda2002post} So although two expressions might be semantically identical, choosing one over the other can have a substantial effect on actual communication, depending on who is speaking, and, crucially, who is listening. We thus take the pragmatic slogan seriously that there is far more to communication than the literal meaning of the expressions employed.
When studying the use of language as the transfer of information, the issue becomes to explain how there can coexist equally good - expressive, accurate, etc. - forms of communication, yet some options are used rather than others.

Based on our model we will present three core results: First, we will offer a formal explanation for the reason why offensive use of language is so persistent. Given that there are many ways of putting things, how come people still offend and harm each other?  Second, we will argue that there is potential for better communication, benefitting everyone. Third, we will argue that the degree of ''empathy'' language users exhibit is of crucial importance to reap those benefits.

We will rely on game theoretic models of the \textit{Iterated Best Response} (IBR) family. This approach looks to explain and predict pragmatic inferences of natural language users by modeling a forth-and-back reasoning taking place between two agents engaged in conversation.
Our main formal addition to such models is that we want to forgo the common assumption that it is exclusively the player sending a message for whom this is is costly. We will look at signaling games where costs are conncected not only to the sender, but also to the recipient.
We will offer some take on these questions by following this outline:

\section{Game Theory and Pragmatics}
\subsection{Signaling Games}
Signaling games are sequential games between two players: a sender and a receiver. In the context of linguistic modeling one can usually think of the sender as a speaker and of the receiver as a listener. The game is playerd in some particular state of the world, formally an element of set $T$ which represents possibles ways the world could be. Only the sender knows which state this happens to be. The receiver, however, has some beliefs about the possible states. These beliefs are modeled with a probability measure, so that $T$ is sample space and $P_R$ is probability measure which is a function $P_R: T\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ satisfying $\sum_{t\in T}P_R(t)=1$.

The game is then played such: After the sender observes the true state of the world $t$ she sends some message $m_i$ out of a set of messages $M$.
The receiver then observes which element $m_i$ from $M$ was sent and chooses some action $a_j$ from a set of actions $A$.
The players' respective utility is given by functions $u_S$ and $u_R$. They take as arguments the state the players find themselves in and the action performed by the receiver, so that $u_S(t,a)$ and $u_R(t,a)$. We will only consider cooperative games, so that $u_S(t,a)=u_R(t,a)$ for $\forall t\in T$ and $\forall a\in A$.
What message is being sent does not directly affect the players' payoff, for the message is not part of the utility function. Hence, the only effect a message can have is by altering the receiver's belief. Different beliefs have the potential to alter her optimal action and thereby to affect both players' payoff.
The sender's strategy is a function from the set of states $T$ to the set of messages $M$; the receiver's strategy is a function from the messages $M$ to the set of actions $A$.
%We could already introduce priors, cost and expected utility here.
We call a strategy \textit{pure} if a player will choose a some action with certainty, that is, always, when confronted with a given situation. In contrast to pure strategies stand
\textit{mixed} strategies where players will choose from various actions, each with a certain probability.

\subsection{Extension towards pragmatics}
Game theoretic modeling has been used for of a variety of phenomena related to information transmission. See, for notable examples, \cite{spence1973job, smith1982evolution, cho1987signaling}.
In linguistics, it was applied in attempts to obtain a firmer conceptual grip on Gricean pragmatics. Here the communication between (rational) agents is thought of as a game played between interlocutors. Formulating situations where pragmatic phenomena arise with mathematical precision helps in different ways: On the one hand, it allows bridging the gap between theoretical work on pragmatics and actual experimental data with language users. More specifically, it generates testable predictions about language use under a variety of parametrizations, as pertaining to the agent's (limited) rationality, cognitive ability to think multiple steps ahead, their preferences and methods of deciding on what action to take - so-called \textit{choice rules} %References? perhaps paolo's phd thesis?
 - or their beliefs about the world. On the other hand, such models ought to provide insight into how agents actually arrive at the linguistic behavior they exhibit. %Do you like the last sentence? or do you prefer "...arrive at their linguistic behaviour"?
 Indeed, models concerned with pragmatic behavior of linguistic agents are caught between the pressure of trying to accurately predict and fit experimental data and the hope to realistically capture one or the other aspect of a pragmatic phenomenon - to represent ''what actually is going on'', so to speak.

The family of models we will be concerned with tries to capture the agents' mutual reasoning about each other. Which action the players deem optimal for them and perform depends on a process of reasoning about what the respective other believes. The model tries to capture this process of reasoning about what the respective other does, believes that her opponent will do, believes what her opponent will believe that she will do, and so forth. %Our model will be an extension of this ''Pragmatic Back-and-Forth Reasoning'' \cite{franke2014pragmatic}.
%Should we mention it explicitly? or just name it as a reference when we give the introduction to the workings of the model?
\subsection{The IBR model}
We are going to use the \textit{iterated best response} (IBR) to provide our solution concept. %WHY?
For details and discussion see \cite{franke2009signal} and \cite{franke2014pragmatic}. IBR relies on an explicit representation of the agents' beliefs about each other. The interlocutors beliefs are spelled out in a round-for-round manner in order to capture what intuitively could be the described as the epistemic dynamic of: ''I think that you think that I think that you think...etc.''. Language users are represented to have some hierarchically ordered level of sophistication which correspond to the number of steps an agent can reason forth and back between herself and the other agents. The reasoning chain formed by such steps is then a sequence of iterated optimal responses. It is bounded by the maximal depth a player of a given level of sophistication - or strategic type - can go to.

Entirely unsophisticated types, players who do not take the opponents reasoning into account at all and are thus completely unstrategic, are assigned the level-0. In the games under discussion in this paper this will mean that senders of level-0 will be only concerned with saying whatever is true according to the semantics of the language fragment in question, while receivers of that level will always interpret a message they receive literally. An agent of level-$k$ then forms some belief about the other's behavior who, by assumption, is of some level $l$, where $k\geq l$. Intuitively, this can be interpreted as the player looking down the sophistication hierarchy in order to build some rational expectation of what the other of some specified level $l\leq k$ will do. It is common to assume for simplicity that players of level $k$ expect their opponents to reason exactly one step less than themselves and are thus of level $k-1$.

As in standard signaling games, $T$ is the set of states the players can be in, $M$ the set of messages at the sender's disposal and $A$ the set of actions from which the receiver can choose. Assume for now that $T,M$ and $A$ are all countably finite. A sender strategy is a row-stochastic $(|T| \times |M|)$-matrix $\sigma$, and a receiver strategy is a row-stochastic $(|M|\times |A|)$-matrix $\rho$. By way of example, here are two strategies for a game with $|S|=|A|=3$ and $|M|=2$, so three states and actions, and two messages. \\
%Do we need the examples? Do we have space for the examples?
%This whole section can be made shorter.
\begin{equation*}
\sigma =
    \bordermatrix{
          & m_1 & m_2    \cr
      t_1 & 0.2 & 0.8  \cr
      t_2 & 0.4 & 0.6  \cr
      t_3 & 1 & 0
    }\qquad
\rho =
    \bordermatrix{
              & a_1 & a_2 & a_3    \cr
          m_1 & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0  \cr
          m_2 & 0.8 & 0.1 & 0.1
        }\qquad
\end{equation*}

When the sender observes some state, her strategy determines with which probability she chooses from the different messages; likewise for the receiver, but with messages and actions. The rows in the strategy matrices thus represent the situations where the players get to decide, and the respective entries in the row describe the probabilities with which they opt for the move in that column. The sender, in this example, would choose $m_1$ with probability $0.2$ upon observing $t_1$, and with probability $1$ when observing $t_3$. The receiver, in turn, would choose $a_1$ and $a_2$ each with probability $0.5$, while never playing $a_3$, when receiving $m_1$ from the sender.
%Here is the place to use the definition of pure and mixed strategies. If we actually want to define them before.

The meaning of the language fragment in question is modeled as a $(|T| \times |M|$-matrix. If some state $t_i$ semantically warrants the utterance of some message $m_j$, then the entry $x_{ij}$ in the matrix will be $1$, otherwise $0$. This matrix reporting the boolean values is called the \textit{Boolean Matrix} and denoted by $B$. For the purpose of illustration, an example where both $t_1$ and $t_2$ can be distinctly expressed, but the game contains no message meaning $t_3$:\\
%Do we need this example? I would say it's the first to go if we run short of space.
\begin{equation*}
B =
    \bordermatrix{
              & m_1 & m_2    \cr
          t_1 & 1 & 0  \cr
          t_2 & 0 & 1  \cr
          t_3 & 0 & 0
        }\qquad
\end{equation*}

The strategies of level-0 type are represented by the normalized boolean matrix. Normalization here simply means a mapping of some $(m\times n)$-matrix $A$ onto some other $(m\times n)$-matrix $B$ such that $B_i\propto A_i$ if $\sum_j (A_{ij})>0$ and $B_{ij}=\tfrac{1}{n}$ otherwise. In the case of the receiver the transposed boolean matrix is normalized.

More sophisticated players are modeled as to have some belief about the interlocutors behavior. For now we will assume that players have unbiased beliefs, meaning that there are no further restriction imposed - for example, that some player simply disregards a possible strategy. A belief is unbiased if all elements $x\in X$ of some (finite) set X are deemed to be equally probable. All $y\not\in X$ are assigned probability zero. So that each option is considered equally likely. We thus follow Franke's argument for
%Franke Phd also contains probabilistic argument about the Principle of Indifference
 using unbiased beliefs about possible opponent behavior as it allows us to simplify the mathematics and allows for more straightforward computation in linguistic applications. Formally, if $X$ is some ordered set of strategies of cardinality $\mathbb{C}$, then the set of beliefs $\Pi$ is defined as\\
\begin{equation*}
\Pi(X)=\{\sum_{x\in X} \dfrac{1}{\mathbb{C}}X\}
\end{equation*} %i don't understand this equation

%HERE WE NEED A PARAGRAPH ABOUT PRIORS FOR RECEIVER AND COST VECTORS IN GENERAL. this is also the chance to mention the vector notation later applied.

Finally, we define the notion of \textit{best response} given a set of beliefs. A sender's best response to some receiver strategy $R$ is any strategy that maps each state to that signal which maximizes the expected utility. In case $n$ signals are tied for expected utility, the sender will play each with probability $\tfrac{1}{n}$.
%More formally speaking, the sender's best response to some receiver strategy is\\
%\begin{equation*}
%BR_S(R)=\{s\in S | s_{ij}=1\implies j \in arg_kmax(U_S T(\rho)-c)_ik)\}
%\end{equation*}
A receiver's best response to a sender's strategy $S$ is defined almost analogously. Except that there may be so-called \textit{surprise messages} $m_j$ for which $R{ij}=0$, for all $i$. These are messages the sender will use with probability 0, that is, never. Since strategies are plans of action for every conceivable contingency that might arise in the course of a game, we'll assume that a receiver will then play each option with probability $\tfrac{1}{|A|}$.
%Do we need the the following?
As the sender has a set of beliefs $\Pi$ about the receivers possible behavior, the set of best responses is the union of all best responses to these possible strategies: $BR(\Pi=\Cup\{BR(\pi)|\pi\in\Pi\}$.

\section{Sticks and Stones}
\subsection{Exposition of Phenomenon/Interpretation}
%This needs to be introduced.

Consider the following scenario: Two people sharing some language engage in conversation, one as the speaker, the other as the listener. The speaker would like to communicate to the listener what kind of work a mutual acquaintance of the two does. The listener does not yet know what her occupation happens to be, but would like to do so. The acquaintance could either be an ecologist or a geologist. To transfer this knowledge the speaker can utter either ''She's a geologist.'', ''She's an ecologist.'' or ''She's a professional treehugger, stupdily trying to protect plants and stuff.''. Assume that uttering the first is true just in case the person is a geologist and the other two if she's an ecologist. As both of the two well know, the listener cares dearly for the environment, while the speaker does not. The listener, although she understands perfectly well what the speaker is trying to convey to her, would be deeply offended by her uttering the word ''treehugger''. The speaker herself couldn't care less what words she uses, as long as the message comes across and the hearer adopts the right belief about the mutual acquaintance's profession.

This is an interesting situation, for the the speaker could perfectly well achieve her goal of communication and not use the word ''treehugger''. The listener, who is not in any position to choose the signal, then has to accept the speaker's decision grudgingly, knowing that there would have been a better way for her. Alas, it was not the better way for the sender and was thus not chosen. This situation can be modeled fittingly using the IBR approach introduced in previous sections. We will do so, and then carry out further analysis on the baseline set by this model.
\subsection{Asymmetric Model}
\subsubsection{Game Structure}
Let us now use the IBR model to model the scenario above. Assume that For completeness sake we expand scenario by adding one more utterance ''She's a professional stonehugger who cares more about lifeless things than people.'' We therefore have
%equiprobability of states needs to be mentioned here. also this could be shorter.
two players which are talking with each other using some shared language fragment. Although they have this common language, they are triggered by different messages. Say that a geologist and an ecologist are talking and they discuss each others professions. Thus we define the states as $T=\{geologist, ecologist\}$ and set $T=A$. They both share the goal of successful communication, thus we set their utilities such that when the speaker wants to communicate $t_{j}$ by some message $m_i$ then they both have equal positive utility when the receiver to associates $m_i$ with $t_{j}$. Thus we have:

\begin{equation*}
\bordermatrix{
      & t_{geologist} & t_{ecologist}    \cr
  t_{geologist} & a,a & 0,0  \cr
  t_{ecologist} & 0,0 & a,a
}\qquad
\end{equation*}
Where $a>0$.

Let us now assume that we have four messages $M=\{geologist, stonehugger, ecologist, treehugger\}$ with the given sematic meaning:
 \begin{equation*}
 B =
 \bordermatrix{
            & m_{geo} & m_{stone} & m_{eco} & m_{tree}    \cr
   t_{geo}  &       1 &         1 & 0       & 0 \cr
   t_{eco}  &       0 &         0 & 1       & 1
 }\qquad
 \end{equation*}

 And further assume that $m_{stonehugger}$ is a trigger message for the geologist and $m_{treehugger}$ is a trigger messages for the ecologist. We therefore define $c^G$ as a cost vector for the geologist and $c^E$ for the ecologist:

  \begin{equation*}
  c^G =
  \bordermatrix{
             & m_{geo} & m_{stone} & m_{geo} & m_{tree}    \cr
             &       0 &         o^G & 0       & 0
  }\qquad
  c^E =
    \bordermatrix{
               & m_{geo} & m_{stone} & m_{geo} & m_{tree}    \cr
               &       0 &         0 & 0       & o^E
    }\qquad
  \end{equation*}

Where $c>0$.

Furthermore we assume that the receiver is unbiased with respect to which state holds, thus $p=(0.5,0.5)$.

Usually language users will encounter the expressions of their language many times over the course of their communicative lives - both as listeners as well as speakers. To capture this we'll posit a third player - nature - which decides at the beginning of the game who of the two players gets to talk and who gets to listen. As rational language users they will need to have some plan of action for all roles, states of the world or messages they encounter. During game play we assume that the geologist is the speaker and the ecologist the receiver thus $c^R=c^E$ and $c^S=c^G$.

\subsubsection{Game Play}
As a first step, let's determine what the naive players' strategies are:\\
\textbf{Level-0 Players}\\
\begin{equation*}
S_0=Norm(B)=
\bordermatrix{
            & & & &    \cr
 &       0.5 &         0.5 & 0       & 0 \cr
 &       0 &         0 & 0.5       & 0.5
 }\qquad
R_0=Norm(T(B))
\bordermatrix{
            &  & \cr
    & 1 & 0 \cr
     & 1 & 0 \cr
     & 0 & 1 \cr
     & 0 & 1 \cr
 }\qquad
\end{equation*}
The naive sender has no principle to decide between sending either $m_{geo}$ or $m_{stone}$ when whishing to communicate $t_{geo}$. Similarly she has no principle to decide between sending either $m_{eco}$ or $m_{tree}$ when whishing to communicate $t_{eco}$. This is represented by her sending each message half of the time. So she plays a mixed strategy. The receiver's actions are clearly determined by a pure strategy.\\
What is the best response of the level-1 hearer and speaker? Following the IBR procedure we transpose $R_0$, subtract the cost vector $c^S$ and check row-wise for the best response to obtain $S_1$. We proceed analogously for the receiver, the main difference being in this case that the receiver faces some actual cost, $c^R$. This then yields strategies for level-1 players:\\ %TODO : we need to add the prior. %
\textbf{Level-1 Players}\\

     & 1 & 0 \cr
     & 0 & 1 \cr
     & 0 & 1 \cr
 }\qquad
\end{equation*}
We see that $R_1=R_0$ thus we conclude that $S_2=S_1$.
\begin{equation*}
R_2=BR_R(T(S_1)-T(c^R)=
\bordermatrix{
            &  & \cr
    & 1 & 0 \cr
     & 0.5 & 0.5 \cr
     & 0 & 1 \cr
     & 0 & 1 \cr
 }\qquad
\end{equation*}
$S_3=S_2$ and $R_3=R_2$. Since $S_3$ and $R_3$ are the best responses to each other, we have reached a stable strategy. 
Some remarks about these strategies are in order. First, the sender will never send the message she finds offensive. This makes perfect intuitive sense, because she has a non-costly alternative which spares her from uttering ''stonehugger''. Second, the receiver views $m_{stone}$ as a surprise message. Although the sender will never play it, the receiver still needs has some plan of action for that contingency. Thirdly, while a sender of level zero still harms herself by blindly sending a costly message, senders above level zero will stop doing so. Thus, $m_{stone}$ will not be seen on higher levels.

\subsection{Informal problem characterization}
Here's what's unsatisfactory with this situation: Successful communication yields equal payoffs of $a$ for both players. Indeed, the \textit{sender's payoff} is always $a$, for the the strategy pair $<S_3,R_3>$ entails successful communication. For the receiver, however, the story is different. In $S_3$ $P(m_{tree})=0.5$ if $t_{eco}$ holds. Since $P(t_{eco})=0.5$ $m_{tree}$ is sent in $\tfrac{1}{2}\times \tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{1}{2}$ of all cases on average, inflicting a cost of $c$. In expectation, she will thus obtain a mere payoff of $a-\tfrac{c}{4}$.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Expected Payoff for Level of Sophistication}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
                                    & Sender                                  & Receiver                                \\ \cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Level-0}        & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$a-\tfrac{o^S}{4}$} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$a-\tfrac{o^R}{4}$} \\ \cline{2-3}
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Level-k, $k>0$} & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$a$}                  & \multicolumn{1}{l|}{$a-\tfrac{o^R}{4}$} \\ \cline{2-3}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As a way of intuitive explanation, consider the positions the agents are facing in this game. Whether the receiver likes the message or not, she can always reason what her interlocutor wants to communicate to her. If the messages $m_{geo}$ or $m_{eco}$ are sent, she will chose the corresponding action, communication is successfull, so both players get their payoff and everyone is happy. If the message $m_{tree}$ is sent, however, she pays the associated cost. Still, she knows what the sender is trying to communicate and her best response will be to cooperate. Refusing to understand is not an option, for it would only add insult to injury; she would both pay the cost of hearing $m_{tree}$ and lose the payoff of understanding correctly. Because the sender can anticipate the receiver to behave this way, she does not need to care about sending either semantically correct message.

Now, actual language use is an activity which agents engage in repeatedly, sometimes as speakers, sometimes as listeners. To model this we assumed they play above game many times, each either role with equal probability. Because the game is symmetrical, we can simply interchange the expected payoffs for the two agents if they play in the other role. Over the course of a lifetime of conversation - a sufficient amount of linguistic interactions - the players can expect a utility of $\tfrac{1}{2}\times a + \tfrac{1}{2}\times (a-\tfrac{o^i}{4})=a-\tfrac{o^i}{8}$, for $i\in \{1,2\}$. 
%Notice that $a-\tfrac{o^i}{8} > a-\tfrac{o^i}{4}$, for any $o^i,a>0$.
%Check whether this is right.
%I would like to have high-indexed cost entries to the matrix depending on the players.
 
The crucial observation to make here is that the agents could have done better. To see this, imagine the agents only used $m_{eco}$ and $m_{geo}$ to communicate. If neither of them would ever inflict a cost and communication could still be reliably successfull, then both receive a full payoff of $a$.
Never playing costly messages formally means that the respective sender plays strategy $S_*$ where neither $m_{tree}$ nor $m_{stone}$ are ever played.

If this sender strategy is still able to convey the correct state, then everyone is better or at least as well off as before. In fact, such an improvement would imply satisfying a criterium for efficiency, namely the  \textit{Pareto optimality}. When the sender plays $S_*$ the receiver then plays $R_*$.

Formally, some strategy is Pareto optimal if it is not \textit{Pareto dominated} by some other strategy. Pareto domination, in its turn, is defined as follows:
Let $S$ be a set of strategies, $N$ a set of players, from 1 to n, and $u_i$ be each player's utility function. A strategy $s \in S$ Pareto dominates another strategy $s' \in S$ if:
\begin{equation*}
\forall i \in N: u_i(s) \geq u_i(s') \land \exists j \in N: u_j(s) > u_j(s')
\end{equation*}

If strategy $s'$ gives any player a higher utility than $s$, while no other player's utility decreases, we say that the $s'$ \textit{Pareto dominates} $s$.

We claim that the strategy pair $<S_*,R_*>$ is Pareto optimal. In the next chapter we show how we can adjust the IBR model to reach the strategy pairs $<S_*,R_*>$ and show that $<S_*,R_*>$ is Pareto optimal.

\section{Solution concept}
We have presented the problem of offensive language use and now we will present a solution which can explain offensive and non-offensive language use and puts the speaker in a position to decide between offensive and non-offensive language use. The core idea is to model the disposition of the speaker towards the receiver. For an example, the speaker can be indifferent, empathetic or even hostile towards the receiver. By modelling this disposition it allows us to make it in the speaker's interest to take the receiver's preferences into account. Furthermore we show that only if the speaker acts empathetically a Pareto optimal solution can be reached.

\subsection{Solution statement informal}
We have shown that a optimal strategy can be reached if we adjust the sender's best response. We did not see the optimal strategy in the IBR model since it is not explicitly in the sender's interest to consider the receiver's interests and, coincidentally, it is her who wields the power to decide if an offensive message is sent or not. Furthermore we saw that if we added a third player, nature, to decide the players' positions, both players were worse off if they did not take the other preferences into account. Thus both players must take the receiver's preferences into account and base the response such that is not offensive for the receiver, i.e. the sender must refrain from sending costly messages for the receiver. If the sender does not send receiver costly messages successful communication is still established and the receiver did not incur any cost in the process. Thus a Pareto optimal solution. We therefore adjust the IBR model by adjusting the sender's response such that she takes the receiver's cost into account.

\subsection{Solution statement formal}
We extend the sender's cost vector to $c^{S*}$ s.t. % use something else for the new cost vector...
$$c^{S*}=c^{S} + d \cdot c^{R}$$
Where $d \in \mathbb{R}$. Then we define the sender's best response with disposition to the receiver as:
\begin{equation*}
BR_S(\rho)=\{s\in S | s_{ij}=1\implies j \in arg_kmax(U_S T(\rho)-c^{S*})_ik)\}
\end{equation*}
That is, just like before but now with $c^{S*}$ instead of $c^{S}$. We can now see that setting $d=0$ we get the original best response since then $c^{S*}=c^{S}$.
Let us now go through the symmetric game again with the extended sender's cost. $S_0$ and $R_0$ remain unchanged so let us start with $S_1$:
\begin{equation*}
S_1= BR_S(T(R_0)-c^{S*})=
BR_S(
\bordermatrix{
            & & & &    \cr
 &       1 &         1 & 0       & 0 \cr
 &       0 &         0 & 1      & 1
 }\qquad
-
\bordermatrix{
            & & & &    \cr
 &       0 &         o^S & 0       & d \cdot o^R \cr
 }\qquad
)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
=BR_S(
\bordermatrix{
                & & & &    \cr
     &       1 &         1-o^S & 0       & 0-d\cdot o^R \cr
     &       0 &         0-o^S & 1      & 1-d\cdot o^R
 }\qquad
 )
 \end{equation*}
immediately we see that depending on the value of $d$ there are different sender responses. If $1<0-d\cdot o^R$ the sender's best response will be to send receiver costly messages over communication.  If $1>1-d\cdot o^R$ the sender's best response will be to send receiver non-costly messages over others. We can also see that if $d=1$ the receiver's cost is treated equally to the sender's cost. We define $d=1$ as an \textit{empathetic disposition}. Let us now continue with $d=1$.

\begin{equation*}
S_1=BR_S(
\bordermatrix{
                & & & &    \cr
     &       1 &         1-o^S & 0       & 0-o^R \cr
     &       0 &         0-o^S & 1      & 1-o^R
 }\qquad
 )
=
\bordermatrix{
                & & & &    \cr
     &       1 &         0 & 0       & 0 \cr
     &       0 &         0 & 1      & 0
 }\qquad
 =S_*
 \end{equation*}
$R_1=R_0$ thus $S_2=S_1$ and we end with $S_2$ and $R_2$ as a stable strategies.
\begin{equation*}
  R_2= \bordermatrix{
              &  & \cr
      & 1 & 0 \cr
       & 0.5 & 0.5 \cr
       & 0 & 1 \cr
       & 0.5 & 0.5 \cr
   }\qquad
   =R_*
\end{equation*}
And indeed these strategies are Pareto optimal since the expected utility for both players is $a$. Thus we conclude by stating that if the sender takes up an \textit{empathetic disposition} towards the receiver's cost a Pareto optimal solution is reached.
\subsection{Conclusion}
%Haukur ideas%
It is hard to perceive which dispostion is held by the speaker in daily langauge use because we always base our word selection on incomplete information about the sender's preferences.
Being empathetic might strike some poeple as a Dove and Hawk game (clarify better) but our model does not associate any cost by being empathetic as well as the resources (utility of communication) are shared it really does not makes sense to view empathetic in such a light.
