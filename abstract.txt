In this paper, we provide a formal framework to analyze the pragmatic phenomenon of harmful use of language. If particular word choices are not a central element in the transmission of information and may even be an impediment to the speaker, why may they still refrain from using certain expressions rather than others? Furthermore, under which circumstances are speakers disposed to alter their way of expressing themselves? We address these questions in the context of game theoretic models of natural language use. Specifically, we analyse situations where a speaker is indifferent to the use of one expression over another, while her audience has a clear preference. So although two expressions might be semantically identical, choosing one over the other can have a substantial effect on actual communication. We will present three core results: First, we offer a formal explanation for the reason why the offensive use of language is so persistent. Second, we argue that there is potential
for better communication, according to efficiency standards presently introduced. Third, we will argue that the degree of empathy language users exhibit is of crucial importance to reap these benefits. Our formal contribution is to forgo the common assumption that it is exclusively the player sending a message for whom the word choice is costly. Our exposition proceeds as follows: In Section 2 we give a brief introduction to the application of game theory to the study of pragmatics as well as the specifics of the model we use. Section 3 contains the modelâ€™s application to message related cost and a discussion of its predictions, while Section 4 presents the addition of costly signals to extend the model. Section 5 discusses the results and concludes.
